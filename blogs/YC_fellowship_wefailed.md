## YC Fellowship - we failed to submit

YC announced a fellowship around the 20th of July. It was an awesome initiative considering the fact that, well, its YC, and they would provide a 3 month mentorship. Add to this the fact that YC was giving away 12k USD without taking any equity. It was a no-brainer. 

One of us got down to filling up the application, and letting the others know what all would be required. Apart from the basic details of the product, YC had asked for a product demo video and founders' introduction video. Having 2 designers as members of the founding team, we could really put in a great product demo in the application. 

All of us got down to doing our part, with one among us leading the effort. In about a day's work , our application had already started looking really strong. We had a terrific idea, a good market research to support our claims, and 2 great product demos to demonstrate that we were not just making stuff up. We had already successfully built v0.1 of the product.

The most challenging aspect of the application was the 120 word limit. If you are working on a product that not many people can imagine right away, its really tough to convey your point in just 120 words. We cut down every word that wasn't adding value to the response, while still trying to keep it gramatically correct. 

After many iterations, the application that we produced was exceptional. It was coherent, well defined, and concise. We had worked really hard, and it showed. A few touch ups were required, and thats about it. The application deadline was the next day. We were well on track and ready to submit.

Then something really unexpected happened. Just as we opened the link for submitting our application, the screen promptly displayed,
```
There are presently no open calls for applications
```
Our hearts skipped a beat. We thought we had a real chance of getting selected for the interview round. We still don't know what happened. Somehow we had managed to set a timer that was 4 hours late.

*I will skip over all the drama about how we felt. You get it basically.*

It took us some time to recover. 

Now, that I have had time to think about it, I feel it didn't do us as much damage as we originally thought. If anything, we gained from it. Granted, that the fellowship would have accelerated our development process, but it couldn't have made our product any more successful. That is up to us entirely.

What if YC had never announced their fellowship? Or even worse, what if YC did not exist at all? Would we still have pursued this idea? Of course **yes**! Would we still have had the same feeling that we really are on to something big? Hell **yes**! Then what difference does it make! It was just one of the battles that could have made winning the war easier. But even without it, its not all that difficult!

On the positive aspect of it, we realized that the overall experience had added to us on many fronts
* We now had a really concise definition of our product
* We had a better website, with 2 great product videos
* We had finally been able to put our verbal estimations into concrete numbers after a detailed market survey
* We had an almost complete B-Plan 
* We had displayed a tremendous team effort
* And yes. The most important part. We had faced our first failure. And survived!

So to wrap it all up in a bow, or whatever. We did take a hit. But we survived. And came out of it stronger and wiser than before. 

The YC fellowship application process increased our odds of winning.
