<h2>Automating article fetching from hacker news as per my interests</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Current method:
I visit Hacker News atleast once each day, glance at the 30 most popular articles of the day, and bookmark those which seem to be of interest to me using pocket. Most tech people follow this practice. Also add tags tp each document in pocket. This process can be automated quite easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposed method:
The tags in pocket are indicative of my interests and also provide objectified information about each stored document. By using these tags, and the present day list of article titles on hacker news, it is possible to enlist those articles which I might find interesting. Storing them somewhere alongwith that day's date. 
LDA is to be used for this application. K topics can be formed by using the tags currently present in pocket. Each article title can be viewed as a document in the LDA based algo for document classification. If an article sufficiently lies in my interest range, it will be fetched for my reading, with a notification to me via email.
All of this should happen on the could. Alfred will be doing this. </p></li>
